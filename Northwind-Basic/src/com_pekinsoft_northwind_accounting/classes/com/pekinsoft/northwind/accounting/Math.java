     * This function is a way of telling how quickly the company can pay its
     * short-term debts.</p>
     * <p>
     * FORMULA:<br><br>
     * Current Assets / Current Liabilities = Current Ratio
     * <p>
     * EXAMPLE:<br><br>
     * 
     * Total Assets: $15,000.00<br>
     * Current Assets: $8,000.00</p>
     * <p>A <em>current asset</em> is cash or something that can easily be 
     * converted into cash, such as accounts receivable and short-term
     * investments.</p>
     * <p>Total Liabilities: $5,000.00<br>
     * Current Liabilities: $2,000.00</p>
     * <p>A <em>current liability</em> is a debt due within the next twelve (12)
     * months. Accounts Payable, credit card balances, and short-term lines of
     * credit are all current liabilities.</p>
     * <p>
     * Based upon the information provided above, the <em>current ratio</em> is
     * 4 ($8,000.00 / $2,000.00 = 4). This would mean that the example company
     * has four times as many current assets as it does current liabilities, 
     * which means that it could pay of the short-term debt four (4) times
     * before running out of cash.</p>
     * <p>
     * Ideally, a company's current ratio should be greater than one (1). 
     * However, if the company's current ratio is too high, it indicates that 
     * the company is not managing its capital efficiently and, as a result, the
     * company's growth could stagnate.</p>
     * 
     * @param currentAssets         Total current assets.
     * @param currentLiabilities    Total current liabilities.
     * @return The current ratio of the company's financial position.
     * @throws InvalidAccountingDataException In the event data is not provided.
